# Netflex SDK v4.0

> Documentation for the Netflex SDK version 4.0.

The <a href="https://github.com/netflex-sdk" target="_blank">Netflex SDK</a> is a collection of libraries that enables you to work with the <a href="https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/1198765/7159G1N?version=latest" target="_blank">Netflex API</a>.

The Netflex SDK is built on top of the excellent PHP framework, <a href="https://laravel.com">Laravel</a> version 8.

This enables you to leverage much of the existing documentation and tools built around the Laravel ecosystem.

Most Netflex sites are just a regular Laravel 8 application, with Netflex SDK packages and some custom configuration.

The purpose of this document, is to outline where the Netflex SDK and Laravel diverges in behavior and implementation.

When possible, please first refer to <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/7.x">Laravels documentation</a>, and use this documentation as an appendix for that document.
