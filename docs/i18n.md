# Internationaliztion

The `netflex/foundation` package integrates Netflex Labels seamless with [Laravels Localization](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/localization) system.

It is provided as default with the standard template.

## API reference

The full technical API reference for the `Netflex\Foundation` namespace can be [found here](https://netflex-sdk.github.io/docs/api/Netflex/Foundation.html).
## Usage

> [!TIP]
> You may define your labels locally inside of the `resources/lang` directory.
> However, it is recommended to not do that, so that the labels can be managed by the users through Netflexapp instead.

### Configuration
You will have to setup a default locale. This is configured inside `config/app.app` in your project.

```php
<?php

return [
    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Application Locale Configuration
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | The application locale determines the default locale that will be used
    | by the translation service provider. You are free to set this value
    | to any of the locales which will be supported by the application.
    |
    */

    'locale' => 'nb_NO',

    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Application Fallback Locale
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | The fallback locale determines the locale to use when the current one
    | is not available. You may change the value to correspond to any of
    | the language folders that are provided through your application.
    |
    */

    'fallback_locale' => 'en_US'
]
```

The first time you attempt to use a Label, it will be created with the current apps locale. You can manage your labels inside Netflexapp.

## Switching locale

> [!TIP]
> In the context of a Netflexapp defined Page, the [routing system](/docs/routing.md) will automatically switch Locale to the current page's defined locale. A page inherits locale from its parent if not defined.

To check or change your apps locale at runtime, use the built-in helper that Laravel provides.

```php
<?php

use App;

// Checking the current locale
App::getLocale(); // In this case: 'nb_NO'

// Setting the current locale
App::setLocale('en_US');

// Checking locale in a conditional
if (App::isLocale('nb_NO')) {
  echo 'Hei verden!';
}
```
